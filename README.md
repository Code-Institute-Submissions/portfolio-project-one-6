Cumasc Gael are an emerging celtic-bluegrass band based in the North East of Ireland. 

Functioning as a promotional tool for the band, this website will help market the music and image of Cumasc Gael to their specified target audience.

## Planning & Development


- __Business Strategy__

     Recently, the band have moved away from the Irish cover-band circuit to performing their own songs, both as a support band for similar established acts and also as a headline act themselves in some of Ireland's smaller yet renowned indie venues.
 
     The band have since recieved multiple invitations to perform globally, and have recently conducted a small American tour which was extremely well recieved.
    
     Due to the growing popularity of the band, they now require an industry standard "Electronic Press Kit" to promote themselves and their exciting new direction.
     
     Focusing on user centered design, functionality, and exclusive media content, Cumasc Gael aims to provide its specified target audience with a positive and satisfying user experience.
     
- __Target Audience__

    Cumasc Gael are now aiming to share the same market space as similar acts within the indie/bluegrass genre.

    <img src="assets/readme_images/demographic_two.png">

    By collating information gleaned from the targeted Facebook ad campaigns of these groups I have determined the following.

    * Women account for 60% of the target audience
    
    * 24-34 is the key age demographic of the target audience.

    - __Targeting Key Demographics__

    The site's content and how it is displayed is informed by the outcomes of my reasearch . An example of this is presented below. 
    
    According to marketing website [socialtoaster.com](https://www.socialtoaster.com/marketing-to-a-female-demographic-6-tips/),
     women (as an audience) respond positively to social stories that are seen to champion a cause. Women are also interested in compelling news items. 

     <img src="assets/readme_images/target_demo.png">

    In light of this data, (and because women make up the majority of the site's target audience) I have included a news section on the first page of the website featuring a positive social story, in which the band are clearly seen to be championing a worthy cause.

* ### Wireframes  

    Desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes were created using Balsamiq software to give a general overview of the layout of the site and organise the content logically. An image is posted of one of the wireframes below. Links to each wireframe set are also available.

   <img src="README_images/wireframe.png">

    * [Home page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/home_wf.pdf)

    * [Media page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/media_wf.pdf)
    
    * [About page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/about_wf.pdf)

    * [Contact page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/contact_wf.pdf)

    The site conforms to the general structure and scope of these wireframes yet deviates significantly with respect the colour scheme. 

* ### Colour Scheme

    * The predominant feature of the color scheme is undoubtebtly greyscale.
    This stylistic choice and evoke's what the band calls its "Gilded Age" aesthetic, the gilded age being an era before color photography and where traditional music was the popular genre. 

    * The orange in the color scheme is referenced from the fire footer padding image and again is suggestive of a rustic and simpler epoch.  
    
    * The fire image was deliberatly included as flames and fire are also heavily featured in the band's upcoming music video for thier latest single.

# Typography

* ### There are three fonts used throughout the site.

    * Quintessential: A cursive font to envoke the band's aesthetic is used for section headings.

    * Raleway: A popular sans serif font often utilised in modern music websites is used for section sub-headings.  
   
    * Helvetica: A clear, complimentary font often partnered with Raleway is used for all other text.

    The fonts were imported to the stylesheet via google fonts.

    # Testing

    * ### Development Testing

    As this was my first project as a developer, I decided to create a practice repository to test how each part of my code would respond after deployment to several different browsers, devices and operating systems.  

    Initially I was experimenting with how to best use a flexible box model to replicate the look and responsivity of my wireframes. 

    The link to my practice repository is available below.

    * [Cumasc Gael -- Practice Repository](https://github.com/davidcalikes/flex-test)

Much like the wireframes developed during the planning process, the practice repository differs in many areas from the final project. These changes were made not only to improve the look and consistency of the site, but to reduce screen loading times and optimise user experience. I also managed to achieve similar, if not improved results and performance using significantly less lines of code as I began to progress and learn as a developer.  


* ### Testing Technologies 
    I rigorously tested the site during the development phase using using the following:
    * Mac Pro with a 21" Apple Cinema display -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Macbook pro 13" -- Safari, Chrome and Firefox

    * Toshiba Laptop 15" (Windows 10) -- Edge, Chrome and Firefox

    * Apple iPad Mini (5th gen) -- Safari and Chrome

    * Huawei P20 Pro Android Phone -- Chrome and Firfox

    * Samsung Galaxy Tab 7" -- Chrome

    I also used Google Dev-tools to test the sites responsivity in real time and also emulate the sites appearance and responsivity across several other devices.

    <img src="README_images/dev_tools.png">

* ### Validator Testing

    * All pages of the site were passed through the W3C Validator and are error free.
 
    * The CSS stylesheet was passe through the Jigsaw Validator and returned no errors.

* ### Unfixed Bugs

    * On some touchscreen devices an error occurs due to the hover psuedo class which fails to deselect a nav link when a user returns to the previous page via the back arrow.
