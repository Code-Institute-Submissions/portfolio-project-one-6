* ### Wireframes  

    Desktop, tablet and mobile wireframes were created using Balsamiq software to give a general overview of the layout of the site and organise the content logically. An image is posted of one of the wireframes below. Links to each wireframe set are also available.

   <img src="README_images/wireframe.png">

    * [Home page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/home_wf.pdf)

    * [Media page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/media_wf.pdf)
    
    * [About page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/about_wf.pdf)

    * [Contact page wireframes](README_images/wireframes/contact_wf.pdf)

    The site conforms to the general structure and scope of these wireframes yet deviates significantly with respect the colour scheme. 

* ### Colour Scheme

    * The predominant feature of the color scheme is undoubtebtly Greyscale.
    This stylistic choice and evoke's what the band calls its "Gilded Age" aesthetic, the gilded age being an era before color photography and where traditional music was the popular genre. 

    * The orange in the color scheme is referenced from the fire footer padding image and again is suggestive of a rustic and simpler epoch.  
    
    * The fire image was deliberatly included as flames and fire are also heavily featured in the band's upcoming music video for thier latest single.
