                    <p class="news-text"> In 2015, three musicians met on a cold thursday night in the world famous
                        Gartlans Thatched pub in Kingscourt Co.Cavan

                        It was during one of the venue's now legendary Thursday night Trad sessions, that local
                        troubadour Liam Lawman accompanied by nearby Maheracloone banjo player Andrew Kelly first caught
                        the attention of Glaswegian songsmith David Calikes.

                        After many rounds, songs and stories were shared the inception of the band became almost
                        inevitable.

                        Many a garage jam session later and it became even clearer that conceptually and musically these
                        three talented performers were about to embark on an authentic and meaningful creative journey.
